# Parasite Lifecycle

## Lifecycle overview

The lifecycle of P. falciparum is complex and involves many antigenically distinct stages and two hosts: the female Anopheles mosquito and humans (@fig-1). Mosquitos can inoculate between 15--200 sporozoites into a human host, and these infective parasites then undergo development inside hepatocytes to form merozoites. After a period of around 7--10 days sporozoites mature into schizonts which then rupture, and merozoites are released into the bloodstream where they invade red blood cells. Within the red blood cells, merozoites replicate, producing around 16--32 daughter merozoites which are then released into the blood stream following red blood cell rupture, where they reinvade new red blood cells. This process of invasion, replication and release occurs with a periodicity of 24--26 hours, and it is these periodic cycles that are associated with clinical disease manifestations. After approximately 10 days, a subset of red blood cell invading merozoites will differentiate into gametocytes, and these gametocytes continue to circulate in hosts until they are ingested by a feeding mosquito. Sexual reproduction then occurs in the mosquito midgut where gametes fuse to produce a zygote that elongates to become a motile ookinete, invades the midgut wall, and forms an oocyst. Following a sporogonic period of approximately 8--10 days, the oocysts burst to release sporozoites that travel to the mosquito's salivary glands, where they are ready for the cycle to repeat when the mosquito host takes a new blood meal.

*P. vivax* differs from the *P. falciparum* lifecycle in several ways, however, one of the most epidemiologically significant is the ability of *P. vivax* to lie dormant and undetectable in the liver of infected human hosts. This hypnozoite stage can reactivate weeks, months, or even years after the initial infection and re-enters the bloodstream causing relapses in clinical malaria and further onwards transmission. The variation in relapse times results from regional and seasonal variations in mosquito vector populations, with tropical regions tending to experience shorter relapse periods, and longer periods in more temperate areas.
