# Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment

Effective **diagnosis** and **treatment** are essential aspects of malaria control programs. Accurate diagnosis ensures that patients receive appropriate care, preventing the overuse of antimalarial drugs and improving treatment outcomes. Timely and correct treatment not only saves lives but also reduces the spread of drug resistance.

This chapter will explore the key **diagnostic methods**---microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), and molecular techniques---and the situations in which they are most effective. We will also review the **treatment protocols** for both uncomplicated and severe malaria, focusing on first-line therapies and considerations for special populations, such as children and pregnant women.

Finally, the chapter addresses the growing challenge of **drug resistance** and the strategies required to mitigate its impact. By understanding the latest diagnostic tools, treatment protocols, and resistance management approaches, participants will gain practical insights essential for improving malaria case management in diverse settings.
