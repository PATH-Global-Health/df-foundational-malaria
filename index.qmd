# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the "Foundational Malaria Knowledge" module of the PATH Malaria Data Fellowship Program. This module is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of malaria, including its biology, epidemiology, transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. You will explore the global impact of malaria, learn about the critical role of data in controlling the disease, and discover the latest advancements and challenges in the fight against malaria. By the end of this module, you will have the foundational knowledge necessary to contribute effectively to malaria control and eradication efforts.

These lessons contain materials developed by the MACEPA Data and Analytics teams, as well as external resources (links/citations have been included). Any data used in the tutorial will be public data and may have been adjusted from its source in order to be shared.
