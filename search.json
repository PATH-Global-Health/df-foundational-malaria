The term “malaria” itself originates from the Italian words “mala” “aria,” meaning “bad air,” a reflection of the ancient belief that the disease was caused by foul air emanating from marshes and swamps.\nThroughout history, malaria has been a significant burden on many civilizations. Ancient Greeks, including Hippocrates, noted the periodic fevers associated with the disease. Roman scholars also wrote extensively about malaria, describing its symptoms and the environmental conditions conducive to its spread.",

    "text": "1.2 Discovery of the parasite\nThe turning point in understanding malaria came in 1880 when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, a French army surgeon, discovered the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, while working in Algeria. This groundbreaking discovery earned Laveran the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 19071.\nLaveran’s work laid the foundation for further research, leading to the identification of different Plasmodium species responsible for malaria in humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and later, P. knowlesi.\nRonald Ross in 1898 showed that malaria was transmitted from infected mosquitos when they bite humans, this discovery changed the perception of the disease from the previous thinking that it was spread from the foul air of decaying organic matter.\nThese two findings that describe the biological basis of the disease and its transmission were made just under 150 years ago. And at that time malaria was present in almost every country across the Globe (Figure 6.1). Researchers estimate that up to around 1900 human populations were at risk from malaria across about half of the world’s land surface (53%)2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Source: Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/malaria-past-prevalence",

    "text": "1.3 Malaria and human populations\nSince 1900 the malaria map has shrunk, confined to the tropics now, with much of Europe, North America, East Asia, Australia, parts of the Caribbean, South America and Africa having eliminated the disease.\nThe discovery of quinine in the bark of the cinchona tree in the 17th century became the first treatment against malaria and eventually led to the advent of the anti-malarial drug Chloroquine during World War II. In the 20th century, the advent of DDT spraying and the establishment of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Malaria Eradication Program in 1955 marked significant milestones, although the program was discontinued in 1969 due to various challenges and financial and political will for the cause diminishing. The initial aim of eradication was replaced with longer-term control strategies and improvements in disease management.\nThe late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen significant advances in malaria research and control. The development of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the introduction of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have drastically reduced malaria transmission in many regions. In recent years, the focus has shifted towards innovative strategies, including the development of malaria vaccines. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, endorsed by the WHO in 2021, and the R21 vaccine endorsed this past year.\nDespite these advances malaria still remains a significant burden on the worlds population and we shall explore this more in the coming topics.",

At the national level, malaria can hinder economic growth by affecting workforce productivity and increasing healthcare expenditures. In highly endemic areas, malaria can slow economic development and perpetuate cycles of poverty.\nFor example, it was estimated that malaria costs African countries over $12 billion annually in lost productivity, and slows economic growth in the region by 1.3% a year.2 The disease affects school attendance and performance, limiting educational opportunities and future economic prospects for children in affected regions.",

Since untreated malaria can progress to severe forms that may be rapidly (&lt;24 hours) fatal rapid diagnosis and treatment is essential.\nThe first symptoms of disease are usually non-specific and similar to many febrile illnesses. These initial symptoms of malaria occur around 7–14 days following an infectious bite, and patients present with a fever or flu-like illness including shaking, chills, headache, muscle ache and tiredness. Unlike other febrile illness however, malaria fevers are often characterised by their periodic presentation, approximately every two days coinciding with the erythrocyte rupture. At this stage of disease, with prompt treatment with an effective antimalarial, malaria is curable. However, if left untreated or if treatment seeking is delayed, severe malaria complications can occur which often lead to death especially in the case of P. falciparum.\nThe severity of malaria symptoms varies by species:\n\nP. falciparum is associated with severe symptoms, including high fevers, anemia, and potentially fatal complications such as cerebral malaria acute renal failure, severe anemia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nP. vivax often causes milder symptoms but can still lead to severe illness, especially in vulnerable populations. Its ability to relapse makes it a challenging species to control.\nP. malariae typically causes a less severe but chronic infection, which can result in nephrotic syndrome and other complications over time.\nP. ovale causes similar symptoms to P. vivax, with relapses occurring months or even years after the initial infection.\nP. knowlesi infections can be severe and rapidly progress, resembling P. falciparum in clinical presentation but requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment due to its rapid erythrocytic cycle.",

    "section": "4.4 Lifecycle",
    "text": "4.4 Lifecycle\nThe lifecycle of P. falciparum is complex and involves many antigenically distinct stages and two hosts: the female Anopheles mosquito and humans (Figure 6.1). Mosquitos can inoculate between 15-200 sporozoites into a human host, and these infective parasites then undergo development inside hepatocytes to form merozoites. After a period of around 7–10 days sporozoites mature into schizonts which then rupture, and merozoites are released into the bloodstream where they invade red blood cells. Within the red blood cells, merozoites replicate, producing around 16–32 daughter merozoites which are then released into the blood stream following red blood cell rupture, where they reinvade new red blood cells. This process of invasion, replication and release occurs with a periodicity of 24–26 hours, and it is these periodic cycles that are associated with clinical disease manifestations. After approximately 10 days, a subset of red blood cell invading merozoites will differentiate into gametocytes, and these gametocytes continue to circulate in hosts until they are ingested by a feeding mosquito. Sexual reproduction then occurs in the mosquito midgut where gametes fuse to produce a zygote that elongates to become a motile ookinete, invades the midgut wall, and forms an oocyst. Following a sporogonic period of approximately 8–10 days, the oocysts burst to release sporozoites that travel to the mosquito’s salivary glands, where they are ready for the cycle to repeat when the mosquito host takes a new blood meal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The lifecycle of P. falciparum in humans and mosquitos. A) Inoculation of sporozoites and the pre-erythrocytic infection stages in the liver; B) Asexual reproduction and blood stage infection; C) Gametocyte production and ingestion during a bloodmeal; and D) Sexual reproduction and developmental stages within the mosquito.\n\n\n\nP. vivax differs from the P. falciparum lifecycle in several ways, however, one of the most epidemiologically significant is the ability of P. vivax to lie dormant and undetectable in the liver of infected human hosts. This hypnozoite stage can reactivate weeks, months, or even years after the initial infection and re-enters the bloodstream causing relapses in clinical malaria and further onwards transmission. The variation in relapse times results from regional and seasonal variations in mosquito vector populations, with tropical regions tending to experience shorter relapse periods, and longer periods in more temperate areas.",

    "text": "5.2 Anopheles Lifecycle\nMalaria parasites are transmitted by the female mosquito of the Anopheles genus. Anopheles species have four distinct life stages: egg, larva and pupa make up the juvenile aquatic stages before the final adult stage. Juvenile stages last for around 5–14 days depending on the species and the ambient temperature. Once at the adult stage mosquitos tend to mate within a few days of emergence and feed on sugar sources for energy. Female mosquitos will also require a blood meal for the development of her eggs. It is this stage that links the female mosquito and the human hosts in the malaria transmission cycle.\nFollowing a blood meal, the female must rest while the eggs are developed, again this process depends on the ambient temperature taking around two to three days in tropical conditions. Females will then lay their eggs in standing water and continue to seek further blood meals to sustain further egg production. This cycle continues until the female dies, around one to two weeks later.\nChances of survival are dependent on temperature and humidity and the ability of the female mosquito to find a blood meal. In order to transmit parasites mosquitos must survive for longer than the extrinsic incubation period of plasmodium which is around 9–18 days depending on species and temperature (higher temperatures accelerate parasite growth). Many Anopheles species are opportunistic in their feeding behaviour and will take a blood meal from whatever host is available either human or animal. The degree to which a species favours humans, known as anthrophily, determines their efficiency as a vector of malaria. Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus are two highly anthropophilic species that makes them the primary vector in much of sub-Saharan Africa.",

This behavior is critical for malaria transmission, as it coincides with human sleeping patterns, making bed nets an effective intervention.\nEndophagy and Exophagy:\n\nEndophagic mosquitoes prefer to feed indoors, making indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) effective control measures.\nExophagic species feed outdoors, requiring different strategies such as outdoor spraying and environmental management.",

    "text": "6.1 Immune response overview\nDue to the parasites multistage lifecycle, there are several points at which the immune system could respond to the invading threat. Upon first exposure to blood stage parasites, the innate immune system launches a non-specific immune response triggering a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which help to limit parasite growth.10 These cytokine responses also allow for the effective priming of the humoral and cellular-mediated immune responses which then provide adaptive responses upon re-exposure.\nKey to the adaptive immune response is the phenomenon of pattern recognition of parasite antigens by B and T cells, which enables a rapid and more effective parasite specific protective response to each lifecycle stage. However, the exact immune effector mechanisms involved in parasite regulation, control and elimination at each lifecycle stage are not fully characterised. The ability of malaria parasites to evade and interfere with effective immune responses also presents several challenges in mounting and understanding successful immune responses. 11 12 13\nThe key mechanisms understood to play a significant role at each parasite life-stage are shown in Figure 6.1.",

However inflammatory responses associated with immune response to this stage can result in significant immunopathology.\nGametocyte specific antibodies are often poorly induced and not widely circulating in populations",
