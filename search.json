    "text": "1.1 Early References and Discoveries\nMalaria is an ancient disease, with its presence documented as far back as 2700 BCE in Chinese medical writings. The term “malaria” itself originates from the Italian words “mala” “aria,” meaning “bad air,” a reflection of the ancient belief that the disease was caused by foul air emanating from marshes and swamps.\nThroughout history, malaria has been a significant burden on many civilizations. Ancient Greeks, including Hippocrates, noted the periodic fevers associated with the disease. Roman scholars also wrote extensively about malaria, describing its symptoms and the environmental conditions conducive to its spread.",

    "text": "1.2 Discovery of the parasite\nThe turning point in understanding malaria came in 1880 when Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran, a French army surgeon, discovered the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, while working in Algeria. This groundbreaking discovery earned Laveran the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 19071.\nLaveran’s work laid the foundation for further research, leading to the identification of different Plasmodium species responsible for malaria in humans: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and later, P. knowlesi.\nRonald Ross in 1898 showed that malaria was transmitted from infected mosquitos when they bite humans, this discovery changed the perception of the disease from the previous thinking that it was spread from the foul air of decaying organic matter.\nThese two findings that describe the biological basis of the disease and its transmission were made just under 150 years ago. And at that time malaria was present in almost every country across the Globe (Figure 6.1). Researchers estimate that up to around 1900 human populations were at risk from malaria across about half of the world’s land surface (53%)2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Source: Our World in Data https://ourworldindata.org/malaria-past-prevalence",

    "text": "1.3 Malaria and human populations\nSince 1900 the malaria map has shrunk, confined to the tropics now, with much of Europe, North America, East Asia, Australia, parts of the Caribbean, South America and Africa having eliminated the disease.\nThe discovery of quinine in the bark of the cinchona tree in the 17th century became the first treatment against malaria and eventually led to the advent of the anti-malarial drug Chloroquine during World War II. In the 20th century, the advent of DDT spraying and the establishment of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Malaria Eradication Program in 1955 marked significant milestones, although the program was discontinued in 1969 due to various challenges and financial and political will for the cause diminishing. The initial aim of eradication was replaced with longer-term control strategies and improvements in disease management.\nThe late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen significant advances in malaria research and control. The development of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), the introduction of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have drastically reduced malaria transmission in many regions. In recent years, the focus has shifted towards innovative strategies, including the development of malaria vaccines. The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, endorsed by the WHO in 2021, and the R21 vaccine endorsed this past year.\nDespite these advances malaria still remains a significant burden on the worlds population and we shall explore this more in the coming topics.",

Households incur costs related to healthcare, lost workdays, and decreased productivity due to illness or death. At the national level, malaria can hinder economic growth by affecting workforce productivity and increasing healthcare expenditures. In highly endemic areas, malaria can slow economic development and perpetuate cycles of poverty.\nFor example, it was estimated that malaria costs African countries over $12 billion annually in lost productivity, and slows economic growth in the region by 1.3% a year.2 The disease affects school attendance and performance, limiting educational opportunities and future economic prospects for children in affected regions.",

Since untreated malaria can progress to severe forms that may be rapidly (&lt;24 hours) fatal rapid diagnosis and treatment is essential.\nThe first symptoms of disease are usually non-specific and similar to many febrile illnesses. These initial symptoms of malaria occur around 7–14 days following an infectious bite, and patients present with a fever or flu-like illness including shaking, chills, headache, muscle ache and tiredness. Unlike other febrile illness however, malaria fevers are often characterised by their periodic presentation, approximately every two days coinciding with the erythrocyte rupture. At this stage of disease, with prompt treatment with an effective antimalarial, malaria is curable. However, if left untreated or if treatment seeking is delayed, severe malaria complications can occur which often lead to death especially in the case of P. falciparum.\nThe severity of malaria symptoms varies by species:\n\nP. falciparum is associated with severe symptoms, including high fevers, anemia, and potentially fatal complications such as cerebral malaria acute renal failure, severe anemia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome.\nP. vivax often causes milder symptoms but can still lead to severe illness, especially in vulnerable populations. Its ability to relapse makes it a challenging species to control.\nP. malariae typically causes a less severe but chronic infection, which can result in nephrotic syndrome and other complications over time.\nP. ovale causes similar symptoms to P. vivax, with relapses occurring months or even years after the initial infection.\nP. knowlesi infections can be severe and rapidly progress, resembling P. falciparum in clinical presentation but requiring prompt diagnosis and treatment due to its rapid erythrocytic cycle.",

    "text": "4.4 Lifecycle\nThe lifecycle of P. falciparum is complex and involves many antigenically distinct stages and two hosts: the female Anopheles mosquito and humans (Figure 6.1). Mosquitos can inoculate between 15-200 sporozoites into a human host, and these infective parasites then undergo development inside hepatocytes to form merozoites. After a period of around 7–10 days sporozoites mature into schizonts which then rupture, and merozoites are released into the bloodstream where they invade red blood cells. Within the red blood cells, merozoites replicate, producing around 16–32 daughter merozoites which are then released into the blood stream following red blood cell rupture, where they reinvade new red blood cells. This process of invasion, replication and release occurs with a periodicity of 24–26 hours, and it is these periodic cycles that are associated with clinical disease manifestations. After approximately 10 days, a subset of red blood cell invading merozoites will differentiate into gametocytes, and these gametocytes continue to circulate in hosts until they are ingested by a feeding mosquito. Sexual reproduction then occurs in the mosquito midgut where gametes fuse to produce a zygote that elongates to become a motile ookinete, invades the midgut wall, and forms an oocyst. Following a sporogonic period of approximately 8–10 days, the oocysts burst to release sporozoites that travel to the mosquito’s salivary glands, where they are ready for the cycle to repeat when the mosquito host takes a new blood meal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The lifecycle of P. falciparum in humans and mosquitos. A) Inoculation of sporozoites and the pre-erythrocytic infection stages in the liver; B) Asexual reproduction and blood stage infection; C) Gametocyte production and ingestion during a bloodmeal; and D) Sexual reproduction and developmental stages within the mosquito.\n\n\n\nP. vivax differs from the P. falciparum lifecycle in several ways, however, one of the most epidemiologically significant is the ability of P. vivax to lie dormant and undetectable in the liver of infected human hosts. This hypnozoite stage can reactivate weeks, months, or even years after the initial infection and re-enters the bloodstream causing relapses in clinical malaria and further onwards transmission. The variation in relapse times results from regional and seasonal variations in mosquito vector populations, with tropical regions tending to experience shorter relapse periods, and longer periods in more temperate areas.",

    "text": "5.2 Anopheles Lifecycle\nMalaria parasites are transmitted by the female mosquito of the Anopheles genus. Anopheles species have four distinct life stages: egg, larva and pupa make up the juvenile aquatic stages before the final adult stage. Juvenile stages last for around 5–14 days depending on the species and the ambient temperature. Once at the adult stage mosquitos tend to mate within a few days of emergence and feed on sugar sources for energy. Female mosquitos will also require a blood meal for the development of her eggs. It is this stage that links the female mosquito and the human hosts in the malaria transmission cycle.\nFollowing a blood meal, the female must rest while the eggs are developed, again this process depends on the ambient temperature taking around two to three days in tropical conditions. Females will then lay their eggs in standing water and continue to seek further blood meals to sustain further egg production. This cycle continues until the female dies, around one to two weeks later.\nChances of survival are dependent on temperature and humidity and the ability of the female mosquito to find a blood meal. In order to transmit parasites mosquitos must survive for longer than the extrinsic incubation period of plasmodium which is around 9–18 days depending on species and temperature (higher temperatures accelerate parasite growth). Many Anopheles species are opportunistic in their feeding behaviour and will take a blood meal from whatever host is available either human or animal. The degree to which a species favours humans, known as anthrophily, determines their efficiency as a vector of malaria. Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus are two highly anthropophilic species that makes them the primary vector in much of sub-Saharan Africa.",

This preference significantly enhances their role as malaria vectors. For example, A. gambiae is highly anthropophilic, which, coupled with its breeding in proximity to human habitation, makes it one of the most effective malaria vectors globally.\nCrepuscular and Nocturnal Activity: Most Anopheles mosquitoes are active during twilight hours (dusk and dawn) and at night. This behavior is critical for malaria transmission, as it coincides with human sleeping patterns, making bed nets an effective intervention.\nEndophagy and Exophagy:\n\nEndophagic mosquitoes prefer to feed indoors, making indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) effective control measures.\nExophagic species feed outdoors, requiring different strategies such as outdoor spraying and environmental management.",

Upon first exposure to blood stage parasites, the innate immune system launches a non-specific immune response triggering a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which help to limit parasite growth.10 These cytokine responses also allow for the effective priming of the humoral and cellular-mediated immune responses which then provide adaptive responses upon re-exposure.\nKey to the adaptive immune response is the phenomenon of pattern recognition of parasite antigens by B and T cells, which enables a rapid and more effective parasite specific protective response to each lifecycle stage. However, the exact immune effector mechanisms involved in parasite regulation, control and elimination at each lifecycle stage are not fully characterised. The ability of malaria parasites to evade and interfere with effective immune responses also presents several challenges in mounting and understanding successful immune responses. 11 12 13\nThe key mechanisms understood to play a significant role at each parasite life-stage are shown in Figure 6.1.",

    "text": "7.2 Biology and Behavior of Anopheles Mosquitoes\nAs described in the previous chapter, malaria transmission is primarily driven by the Anopheles mosquito, which acts as the vector for the Plasmodium parasite. The biology and behavior of Anopheles mosquitoes are critical to their efficiency as vectors.\n\nFeeding Behavior: Female Anopheles mosquitoes are hematophagous, meaning they feed on blood to obtain the nutrients required for egg development. Their preference for human blood (anthropophily) makes them particularly effective vectors of malaria. Mosquitoes that feed primarily at night are most dangerous because they coincide with human sleep patterns, increasing the likelihood of undisturbed feeding. Blood feeding is really an essential component in the mosquito life cycle. And this is a step in which mosquitoes from different species exhibit quite a variety of behaviors.\n\nSome mosquito species are highly adapted to feeding on humans. So they are highly anthropophilic. While other mosquito species predominantly feed on animals, such as birds, or cows, or rats. The propensity of a mosquito to feed on humans, rather than animals, can actually be measured. And this is the human blood index. The human blood index can be measured by collecting mosquitoes in the field and looking at the content of their blood to see whether it’s from animal or from human origin. This value goes from 0 to 1. With 0, being mosquitoes that feed exclusively on animals, so highly zoophilic. And 1, with mosquitoes that feed only on humans, so highly anthropophilic. Many mosquito species with a high level of anthropophilia actually cluster in Africa. And these mosquitoes belong to mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae complex, such as Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles coluzzii. But also, Anopheles funestus, which is another very important vector of human malaria in Africa.\n\nResting Behavior: After feeding, Anopheles mosquitoes typically rest indoors (endophily) or outdoors (exophily). Indoor resting mosquitoes are targeted by indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), which are effective control strategies.\nFlight Range: Anopheles mosquitoes generally have a limited flight range, typically staying within a few kilometers of their breeding sites. However, their ability to locate humans through carbon dioxide and body odor means that even small numbers of mosquitoes can sustain transmission if they are close to human habitation.",

Vector competence refers to the mosquito’s ability to acquire, maintain, and transmit the malaria parasite. This competence is influenced by factors such as:\n\nSusceptibility to Infection: Some Anopheles species are more susceptible to Plasmodium infection, meaning they are more likely to become infected after feeding on an infected person.\nParasite Development: The development of the malaria parasite within the mosquito, known as the extrinsic incubation period, must be completed before the mosquito can transmit the parasite to another human. This period is temperature-dependent, with warmer temperatures accelerating parasite development.\nFeeding Frequency and Longevity: Mosquitoes that feed more frequently and live longer are more likely to transmit malaria because they have more opportunities to pick up and pass on the parasite.",

If a mosquito survives this period, it becomes infectious and can transmit malaria to humans.

    "text": "7.5 Local vector species composition\nIn any given area, there might be multiple Anopheles species that live in sympatry and this might complicate control measures. For instance, let’s have a look at Africa, and the Anopheles gambiae complex. This complex comprises eight mosquito species that are morphologically identical and can only be distinguished on the molecular level. These species include some of the most important malaria vectors, such as Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, and Anopheles coluzzii. Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii have very similar biting behavior, because they both tend to feed on humans and late at night and indoors. However, they show quite different ecological habitats due to larval developments. Anopheles gambiae tend to prefer living in temporary breeding sites, such as rain puddles. While Anopheles coluzzii prefer living in permanent breeding sites, such as rice fields. Anopheles arabiensis is a third important malaria vector that shares habitats with Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii. Historically, this mosquito species was not considered to be a very important vector for human malaria, because these mosquitoes also feed on animals, apart from humans, and so they dilute potential infectious bites. However, because of their plastic behavior, and the fact that these mosquitoes can feed outdoors and rest outdoors, apart from feeding and resting indoors, these mosquitoes become more difficult to be controlled with current vector control strategies. And so in recent years, they’ve become more and more relevant for malaria transmission.\nWhen multiple mosquito species live in sympatry, it becomes difficult to understand the relative contribution to malaria transmission. The species composition of Anopheles mosquitoes is critically important to malaria transmission because different species vary in their behavior, habitat preferences, and susceptibility to control measures. Changes in the dominant vector species can affect the overall transmission dynamics, influencing where, when, and how intensely malaria is transmitted. For example, species that are more resistant to insecticides or have different feeding patterns may sustain transmission even in areas with strong control measures. Therefore, understanding and monitoring species composition is essential for designing effective and targeted malaria interventions.\nThe recent study by Msugupakulya et al. (2023) highlights a notable shift in the primary malaria vectors in East and Southern Africa over the past two decades.1 Historically, the Anopheles gambiae complex, particularly An. gambiae and An. arabiensis, were the dominant contributor to malaria transmission. However, from 2011 onwards, Anopheles funestus has emerged as the primary vector, especially in regions where insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) have been widely implemented. The changing vector composition suggests that control strategies need to adapt to the evolving landscape and monitor for changes in the species compostion of mosquitos across the continent.",

The study found that outdoor events, including religious, cultural, and social celebrations, often expose people to mosquito bites during evening and nighttime hours when Anopheles mosquitoes are most active. Events like weddings, funerals, male circumcision ceremonies, and religious festivals, where participants stay outdoors overnight, create environments where mosquito bites are common.

    "text": "9.4 Urbanization\nUrbanization presents a complex scenario for malaria transmission. While urban areas typically have lower transmission rates due to better infrastructure and healthcare, unplanned urbanization can create conditions favorable for mosquitoes.\n\nUrban Slums: In rapidly growing cities, informal settlements or slums often lack adequate sanitation and drainage systems, leading to the accumulation of stagnant water, which serves as breeding sites for mosquitoes. Poor housing quality and limited access to preventive measures increase the risk of transmission in these areas.\nShifts in Vector Behavior: In urban areas, mosquitoes may adapt their feeding patterns or find alternative breeding sites, such as containers of standing water in construction sites, broken pipes, or discarded tires. These environmental changes, combined with high population density, can sustain malaria transmission in urban settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResponding to malaria in urban areas: a new framework from WHO and UN-Habitat\n\n\n\nIn 2022 the WHO released a Global Framework for the response to malaria in urban areas.\nGiven the rapidly urbanizing world, most people in malaria-affected countries will soon be living in urban areas. If you take the example of Nigeria, which accounts for about a quarter of the global burden of malaria, nearly half of the population is already living in urban areas.\nThere are many challenges to Urban Malaria - including new and highly adaptive vectors, the challenges of social inequity – an issue found in both rural and urban settings and the rapid and often unplanned urbanization in malaria endemic countries. And then, of course, we are dealing with a lack of financial and other resources. \nThe framework is avaliable here: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240061781",

Higher EIRs indicate more intense transmission, often seen in areas with dense mosquito populations and favorable environmental conditions for breeding.

It provides a measure of the likelihood of someone becoming infected over a specific time period.\n\nThe number of infectious bites that actually progress to malaria per unit of time describes the efficiency of transmission and can be estimated as FOI/EIR.\nThe FOI is often quantified using transmission models of malaria but can also be estimated from cohort studies.\nAnother method of measuring the FOI is using serological markers of malaria infection.

It is important to note that the method of parasite detection (microscopy or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing) will influence the estimate the parasite prevalence.\nParasite prevalence rates measure the burden of both asymptomatic and symptomatic malaria infections at a specific period in time. Parasite prevalence rates have been crucial for mapping global malaria burden reductions and tracking declines in malaria over time.\n\nUse of PR: PR is crucial for detecting asymptomatic carriers who can continue to transmit malaria. It also provides a snapshot of the overall burden of malaria in a population, allowing for the identification of transmission hotspots.\nApplication in Control Programs: PR is used to track trends in infection rates over time, assess the success of interventions, and monitor areas at risk of resurgence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples from the literature\n\n\n\n\nSubmicroscopic Infection in Plasmodium falciparum-Endemic Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\nEstimating malaria parasite prevalence from community surveys in Uganda: a comparison of microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests and polymerase chain reaction",

Clinical malaria incidence can be measured by active or passive case detection or indirectly estimated using other routine health information data.\nIn addition to clinical malaria incidence, measurements of severe malaria at the population level can be determined as the number of severe cases per person year at risk, but is often measured via the number of cases presenting to the hospital. This can be biased by differential levels of access to care and differences in diagnosis of severe malaria.\n\nImportance of Incidence: Monitoring the incidence of clinical malaria provides direct information on the burden of symptomatic disease. This metric is particularly important for understanding the impact of malaria on public health and healthcare systems.\nApplication in Elimination Programs: In areas aiming for malaria elimination, reductions in clinical malaria incidence are a critical indicator of progress. A low incidence rate suggests that transmission is being controlled effectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples from the literature\n\n\n\n\nDefining clinical malaria: the specificity and incidence of endpoints from active and passive surveillance of children in rural Kenya\nThe global distribution of clinical episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria\nEstimating malaria incidence from routine health facility-based surveillance data in Uganda\nUsing ante-natal clinic prevalence data to monitor temporal changes in malaria incidence in a humanitarian setting in the Democratic Republic of Congo\nObservational study: 27 years of severe malaria surveillance in Kilifi, Kenya",

Heterogeneity in malaria transmission exists across all spatial scales, from differences within households to continental geographic variation. Large-scale geographic variation in transmission is primarily driven by climatic and environmental factors including temperature, altitude, land-use and urbanicity and the impact that these have on vector and parasite survival and breeding site availability, for example.\nOn a smaller scale, heterogeneity within communities can be driven by proximity to breeding sites, housing quality and host availability through the ownership and use of bed-nets, and attractiveness to mosquitos. In addition, we also observe substantial temporal variation in malaria transmission which results from seasonal climate patterns, particularly rainfall, with transmission peaking during the rainy season and lowest during the dry season.\nAdditionally, as mentioned above not all infectious mosquito bites result in blood-stage infection, and factors that impact the efficiency of a mosquito bite including immunity and heterogeneity in mosquito biting are also important determinants in the heterogeneity of malaria transmission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples from the literature\n\n\n\n\nUrban malaria in sub-Saharan Africa: dynamic of the vectorial system and the entomological inoculation rate\nModelling the global constraints of temperature on transmission of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax\nEstimating Air Temperature and Its Influence on Malaria Transmission across Africa\nExploring agricultural land-use and childhood malaria associations in sub-Saharan Africa\nRelationship Between Altitude and Intensity of Malaria Transmission in the Usambara Mountains, Tanzania\nThe Risk of a Mosquito-Borne Infection in a Heterogeneous Environment\nFactors Determining the Heterogeneity of Malaria Incidence in Children in Kampala, Uganda.\nHousing Improvements and Malaria Risk in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Multi-Country Analysis of Survey Data\nInsecticidetreated net (ITN) ownership, usage, and malaria transmission in the highlands of western Kenya.\nNonrandom Selection and Multiple Blood Feeding of Human Hosts by Anopheles Vectors: Implications for Malaria Transmission in Papua New Guinea",

    "section": "",
    "text": "13.1.1 History of Drug Resistance:\nChloroquine-resistant P. falciparum first developed independently in three to four areas in Southeast Asia, Oceania, and South America in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Since then, chloroquine resistance has spread to nearly all areas of the world where falciparum malaria is transmitted, with the exception of Central America west of Panama Canal, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic.\nP. falciparum has also developed resistance to nearly all of the other currently available antimalarial drugs, such as sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine, mefloquine, and quinine. Although resistance to these drugs tends to be less widespread geographically, in some areas of the world, the impact of multi-drug resistant malaria can be substantial. Most recently, partial artemisinin resistance has independently emerged in parts of Southeast Asia, South America, and East Africa, impacting the efficacy of artemisinin-based combination therapy, the main class of antimalarials used worldwide.\nChloroquine-resistant P. vivax malaria was first identified in 1989 among Australians living in or traveling to Papua New Guinea. P. vivax resistance to chloroquine is a major challenge in Oceania and some countries in Southeast Asia. Emerging evidence has suggested chloroquine-resistant P. vivax in other countries and regions but has not impacted treatment policies and further evaluation is needed.\n\n\n13.1.2 Mechanisms of Resistance\n\nSingle or Multiple Gene Mutations:\n\nMutations in specific genes, such as the pfkelch13gene, have been associated with artemisinin resistance.\nMutations in pfdhfrand pfdhps genes are linked to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance.\nPfplasmepsin 2-3 copy number linked to piperaquine resistance.\nPfmdr1 copy number linked to mefloquine resistance.\n\nPartner Drug Failure:\n\nIn ACTs, the artemisinin component clears most parasites quickly, while the partner drug (e.g., lumefantrine) eliminates the remaining parasites.\nResistance to partner drugs such as piperaquine has also emerged, further complicating treatment efforts.\n\n\n\n\n13.1.3 Current Impact of Drug Resistance\n\nGeographical Spread:\n\nArtemisinin resistance was initially confined to the Greater Mekong Subregion, but recent evidence suggests delayed clearance times and drug failure are appearing in Africa.\nThe spread of resistance increases the risk of treatment failure and malaria resurgence.\n\nConsequences of Drug Resistance:\n\nHigher treatment failure rates lead to prolonged illness and increased mortality.\nResistance forces health programs to switch to more expensive treatment regimens.\nDrug resistance can compromise Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) programs by reducing the efficacy of SP, a key preventive drug in many regions.\n\n\n\n\n13.1.4 Strategies to Address Drug Resistance\n\nSurveillance and Monitoring:\n\nTherapeutic Efficacy Studies (TES): Regular monitoring of drug effectiveness through TES helps detect early signs of resistance.\nMolecular Surveillance: Tracking mutations (e.g., kelch13) allows programs to monitor the spread of artemisinin resistance.\n\nRotational Use of Antimalarial Drugs:\n\nCycling different ACTs reduces the selection pressure on any one drug, slowing resistance development.\n\nNew Drug Development:\n\nInvestment in next-generation antimalarials is essential. Drugs in the pipeline include triple ACTs (TACTs), which combine artemisinin and two partner drugs to outmaneuver resistance.\n\nCombination Prevention Strategies:\n\nIntegrating preventive interventions such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), and SMC helps reduce malaria transmission, decreasing reliance on antimalarial drugs.\n\n\n\n\n13.1.5 Challenges in Ensuring Access to Diagnostics and Treatment\n\nEquitable Access to Quality Care:\n\nMany communities in malaria-endemic areas lack access to diagnostic tools and antimalarial drugs, leading to delayed treatment or reliance on unregulated drug markets.\nEnsuring supply chain stability and preventing stockouts is a major challenge, especially in remote areas.\n\nTraining and Capacity Building:\n\nEffective malaria management requires trained healthcare workers capable of diagnosing malaria accurately and following treatment protocols. Inadequate training can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.\n\nPatient Adherence and Treatment Completion:\n\nNon-adherence to treatment regimens increases the likelihood of resistance developing. Programs must promote treatment completion and address barriers such as drug side effects and distance to health facilities.\n\nFunding and Resource Allocation:\n\nCombating resistance and ensuring equitable access to treatment require sustained financial investment. However, malaria control programs often face funding shortages and competing health priorities.\n\n\n\n\n13.1.6 Future Directions and Global Cooperation\n\nGlobal Initiatives to Combat Resistance:\n\nThe Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment (GPARC) and the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria provide frameworks for managing resistance.\nRegional networks, such as the Greater Mekong Subregion Partnership, coordinate efforts to monitor and contain resistance.\n\nRole of Research and Innovation:\n\nOngoing research into new drugs and diagnostics is essential to stay ahead of evolving resistance.\nGenomic studies are helping to better understand resistance mechanisms and guide drug development.\n\nCommunity Engagement and Awareness:\n\nEducating communities about malaria prevention and the importance of completing treatment can enhance program success. Community health workers play a crucial role in improving awareness and adherence at the grassroots level.",

    "text": "Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs) are one of the most effective and widely used tools in malaria prevention. By protecting individuals from mosquito bites at night—the peak biting time for Anopheles mosquitoes—ITNs reduce both infections and overall transmission.\nTypes of ITNs:\n\nConventional ITNs: Treated with insecticides that remain effective for several washes.\nLong-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs): These retain their effectiveness for at several years and multiple washes without re-treatment.\n\nHow ITNs Work:\n\nITNs act as both a physical barrier and a chemical deterrent.\nWhen mosquitoes come into contact with the net, they are either repelled or killed by the insecticide.\n\nImpact of ITNs on Malaria Transmission:\n\nStudies show that widespread ITN use can reduce child mortality by 20% and malaria incidence by 50%.\nITNs are most effective when at least 80% of the population in a given area uses them regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStop and Read\n\n\n\nA 2015 paper estimated that almost 68% of the reduction in malaria burden between 2000-2015 can be attributed to the widespread adoption of ITNs.\n\n\nChallenges and Limitations:\n\nInsecticide resistance: Some mosquito populations have become resistant to pyrethroids, the main insecticide used in ITNs.\nNet distribution and usage gaps: Not all households receive enough nets, people don’t always use when in bed, and some may use them for purposes other than malaria prevention.\n\nSolutions and Innovations:\n\nNewer PBO (Piperonyl Butoxide) nets and Dual Active Ingredient (Dual-AI) nets have been developed to counter pyrethroid resistance.\nMass net distribution campaigns and regular monitoring are essential to maintaining coverage.\n\nSee the video below for an indepth look at ITNs and their use in malaria control.",

    "title": "16  Indoor Residual Spraying",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is a malaria prevention method that targets indoor resting mosquitoes. IRS involves coating interior walls and other sprayable surfaces in a house with a residual (long-lasting) insecticide. IRS takes advantage of the indoor resting behavior of many malaria mosquitoes that rest on these surfaces inside houses after taking a blood meal. The insecticide will kill mosquitoes and other insects that come in contact with these treated surfaces for several months. IRS does not directly prevent people from being bitten by mosquitoes. However, IRS usually kills adult mosquitoes after they have fed on blood and rest on a treated surface, which shortens the mosquito’s lifespan and prevents the development and subsequent transmission of malaria parasites to other people. A very high proportion of households in an area, ideally over 80%, must be treated to protect a community.\nHow IRS Works:\n\nIRS works by coating walls with long-lasting insecticides. Mosquitoes that come into contact with the sprayed surfaces are killed.\nIRS is particularly effective against endophilic mosquitoes (species that rest indoors).\n\nWhen and Where to Use IRS:\n\nIRS is deployed in high-transmission areas and during malaria outbreaks.\nIt is often used seasonally, just before the rainy season when mosquito populations increase.\n\nImpact on Malaria Control:\n\nIRS has been instrumental in eliminating malaria in several regions, including parts of Southern Africa.\nIt works best when at least 85% of homes in a targeted area are sprayed.\n\nChallenges and Innovations:\n\nInsecticide resistance limits the effectiveness of IRS.\nPrograms are exploring non-pyrethroid insecticides such as organophosphates and neonicotinoids.\nCommunity acceptance can be a barrier, as people may be reluctant to allow spraying in their homes.\nChanging of the built home environment, behaviours such as building work on residences can also impact the effectiveness of IRS.\n\nSee the video below for an informative explanation of IRS from the WHO",

    "text": "17.1 Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnant women (IPTp)\nAdults who have survived repeated malaria infections throughout their lifetimes usually become partially immune to severe or fatal malaria, though immunity wanes if there is not ongoing exposure to the parasite. However, because of the changes in women’s immune systems during pregnancy and the presence of a new organ (the placenta) with new places for parasites to bind, pregnant women are more susceptible to malaria infection than non-pregnant women.\nMalaria infection during pregnancy can have adverse effects on both mother and fetus, including maternal anemia, fetal loss, premature delivery, intrauterine growth retardation, and delivery of low birth-weight infants (&lt;2500 g or &lt;5.5 pounds), a risk factor for fetal death.\nThe problems that malaria infection causes differ somewhat by the type of malaria transmission area: stable (high) or unstable (low) transmission.\nIn high transmission areas, women have developed immunity that generally prevents severe disease; however, the parasite specifically targets the placenta, leading to an increased risk during pregnancy. In these settings, maternal anemia and delivery of low birth-weight infants (&lt;2500 g or &lt;5.5 pounds) are frequent complications of malaria. It is a particular problem for women in their first and second pregnancies, for younger women, and for women who are HIV-positive.\nIn low transmission areas, women generally have developed no immunity to malaria. Malaria infection is more likely to result in severe malaria disease, maternal anemia, premature delivery, or fetal loss.\nIPTp entails administration of a curative dose of an effective antimalarial drug (currently sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) to all HIV-negative pregnant women in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission, without testing whether or not they are infected with the malaria parasite. IPTp should be given at each routine antenatal care visit, starting as early as possible in the second trimester.\nAn exmaple of IPT-p programs in Kenya is descirbed in this video:",

    "text": "17.2 Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention\nSeasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is the administration of treatment doses of longer-acting antimalarial medications to children at monthly intervals (cycles) in areas of highly seasonal transmission (~60% of annual cases occurring in four consecutive months) with the aim of maintaining protective drug concentrations in the blood throughout a complete season of peak transmission. WHO first recommended SMC in 2012 based on a pooled analysis of clinical trials that demonstrated up to 70% reduction of uncomplicated malaria among young children during the high-transmission season. The recommendation included monthly treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus amodiaquine (AQ) to children 3—59 months of age during the period of peak malaria transmission (typically 3—4 monthly cycles) in the Sahel region of Africa where minimal SP and AQ resistance had been found.\nIn 2022, WHO SMC guidelines were updated to include more flexibility in implementation of SMC in moderate to high malaria burden areas with seasonal transmission, based on local epidemiology, transmission patterns or evidence of effectiveness. In addition, WHO updated a field guide for SMC implementation in 2023.\nChildren less than five years of age are typically targeted for SMC as they are the most vulnerable to serious disease; however, SMC can include older children. Most countries administer SMC via door-to-door campaigns in which a community distributor gives the first day’s dose of SP and AQ and the second and third doses of AQ are given by the child’s caregiver. Other medications can be considered; however, SMC medications should not include compounds that are used to treat clinical disease in SMC distribution regions. In addition, SMC should not be used in areas where other chemoprevention interventions are being used in the same population (e.g., perennial malaria chemoprevention or mass drug administration).\nSince WHO first recommended SMC in 2012, the intervention has scaled up from protecting 0.2 million children per cycle living in two Sahel countries to 49 million children living in 17 countries in sub-Saharan Africa by 2022 (WMR 2023). Post-distribution coverage surveys suggest that this intervention is widely accepted by caregivers. Drug resistance monitoring and systems to evaluate the protective effect of SMC under programmatic conditions at the population level should be supported.\nVideo from the WHO on SMC delivery and the updated guidelines\n\nVideo from Malaria Consortium on the future of SMC and it’s delivery in new geographies following the WHO updated guidelines",

The drug sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been widely used for chemoprevention, including for PMC, although other drugs may be used. PMC is typically delivered during the first one to two years of life primarily during routine vaccination visits delivered through the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) platform. Several countries are implementing pilots of PMC to test additional delivery mechanisms outside the EPI platform, such as community delivery, and to understand the effectiveness of SP for PMC in settings with high SP resistance.\nVideo from the WHO on PMC guidelines",

Malaria parasites are also genetically complex, producing thousands of potential antigens. Unlike the diseases for which we currently have effective vaccines, exposure to malaria parasites does not confer lifelong protection. Acquired immunity only partially protects against future disease, and in many cases, people still become infected with the parasite; malaria infection can persist for months without symptoms of disease.",

GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals’ RTS,S/AS01 became the first malaria vaccine to receive a WHO recommendation for widespread use on October 6, 2021.\nThe vaccine has been in development since the mid-1980s and has advanced thanks to a unique public-private partnership of GSKBio, the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and African and other research organizations, with funding support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Following the pivotal Phase 3 trial in 11 sites from 7 countries showing that the vaccine was efficacious, in 2015 a large-scale pilot implementation accompanied by rigorous evaluation provided the conclusive evidence on feasibility, safety, and population impact that led to the WHO recommendation. Key findings from the malaria vaccine pilots include:\n\nFeasible to deliver: Vaccine introduction is feasible, with good and equitable coverage of RTS,S seen through routine immunization systems, even in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReaching the unreached: RTS,S increased equity in access to malaria prevention.\n\nMore than two-thirds of children in the three pilot countries who were not sleeping under an ITN benefitted from the RTS,S vaccine.\nLayering the tools results in over 90% of children benefitting from at least one preventive intervention (ITN or the malaria vaccine).\n\nStrong safety profile: RTS,S vaccine has a favorable safety profile. By the time of pilot completion in 2023, &gt;6 million doses of the vaccine have been administered with &gt;2.5 million children receiving at least one dose of the vaccine in three African countries, with no new safety signals identified.\nNo negative impact on uptake of bed nets, other childhood vaccinations, or health seeking behavior for febrile illness. In areas where the vaccine has been introduced, there has been no decrease in the use of insecticide-treated nets, uptake of other childhood vaccinations or health seeking behavior for febrile illness.\nHigh impact in real-life childhood vaccination settings: In addition to the 39% reduction in clinical malaria seen in the Phase 3 trial, the pilot found significant reduction (30%) in severe malaria and 13% reduction in all-cause mortality in children, even when introduced in areas where insecticide-treated nets are widely used and there is good access to diagnosis and treatment.\nHighly cost-effective: Modelling estimates that the vaccine is cost effective in areas of moderate to high malaria transmission.\n\nFollowing the WHO recommendation of RTS,S for widespread use in moderate to high transmission settings, next steps included funding decisions from the global health community for broader rollout, and country decision-making on whether to adopt the vaccine as part of national malaria control strategies. Shortly after WHO recommendation, GAVI committed funding to support vaccine introduction and established the application process. The immediate unprecedented demand for the vaccine exceeded the available limited RTS,S supply, leading to development of the transparent, fair, and equitable vaccine allocation framework by WHO and GAVI.\nWHO’s timely recommendation of the second-in-class RTS,S-like vaccine (R21/Matrix-M) in 2023 is expected to result in sufficient vaccine supply to benefit all children living in malaria-endemic areas.",

This technology – that was used in Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine – induces the influx of antigen-presenting cells at the injection site and enhances antigen presentation in local lymph nodes, which means that the immune system is triggered as strongly as possible. In a phase 3 trial, the vaccine was 75% effective when given before the high transmission season, and 68% effective when given on an age-based schedule in areas with year-round malaria\nHowever, the idea is not to replace RTS,S but to be complementary – Gndefinedavi has already approved funding for a malaria vaccine programme and is ready to support rollout of R21 alongside RTS,S.",
