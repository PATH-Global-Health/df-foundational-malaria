# Malaria Endemic Regions

## Geographical distribution

Malaria remains endemic in over 85 countries and territories, with the highest transmission occurring in Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and parts of the Western Pacific and the Americas. In these regions, climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall create favorable environments for the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria.

Interactive maps, such as those provided by the [Malaria Atlas Project](https://malariaatlas.org/), can visually depict the distribution of malaria cases and highlight regions with the highest burden.

## High-Risk Populations

Certain populations are at higher risk of contracting malaria. These include:

-   **Children under five years old**: Due to their developing immune systems, young children are particularly susceptible to severe malaria and death.

-   **Pregnant women**: Pregnancy reduces a woman's immunity to malaria, increasing the risk of severe illness, maternal death, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

-   **Travelers and migrants**: Individuals traveling to or migrating from non-endemic to endemic areas may lack immunity, putting them at greater risk of severe malaria.

-   **People living in poverty**: Limited access to healthcare, preventive measures, and information increases the vulnerability of impoverished communities to malaria.

## Seasonality and Environmental Factors

Malaria transmission varies seasonally, with peaks often corresponding to rainy seasons when mosquito breeding conditions are optimal. Environmental factors such as standing water, vegetation, and climate changes can influence mosquito populations and malaria transmission dynamics.

For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, malaria transmission intensifies during and after the rainy season, while in some parts of Asia and Latin America, transmission can occur year-round but peaks during specific months.
