title: "Prevention and Control"
---

Prevention and control strategies are essential to reducing malaria transmission and achieving elimination goals. These efforts involve a combination of **vector control**, **chemoprevention**, **vaccines**, and **community-based approaches** to interrupt the life cycle of malaria parasites and protect at-risk populations. This chapter explores key interventions and their role in global malaria control efforts.

Throughout this Chapter we will link to some great talks by leading malaria scientists and public health specialists that were hosted by the Ifakara Health Instiitute.
