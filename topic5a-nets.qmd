title: "Insecticide Treated Nets"
---

**Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs)** are one of the most effective and widely used tools in malaria prevention. By protecting individuals from mosquito bites at night---the peak biting time for Anopheles mosquitoes---ITNs reduce both infections and overall transmission.

**Types of ITNs:**

-   **Conventional ITNs:** Treated with insecticides that remain effective for several washes.

-   **Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs):** These retain their effectiveness for at several years and multiple washes without re-treatment.

**How ITNs Work:**

-   ITNs act as both a **physical barrier** and a **chemical deterrent**.

-   When mosquitoes come into contact with the net, they are either **repelled** or **killed** by the insecticide.

**Impact of ITNs on Malaria Transmission:**

-   Studies show that widespread ITN use can reduce child mortality by **20%** and malaria incidence by **50%**.

-   ITNs are most effective when **at least 80% of the population** in a given area uses them regularly.

## Stop and Read

A 2015 [paper](10.1038/nature15535) estimated that almost 68% of the reduction in malaria burden between 2000-2015 can be attributed to the widespread adoption of ITNs.
:::

**Challenges and Limitations:**

-   **Insecticide resistance**: Some mosquito populations have become resistant to pyrethroids, the main insecticide used in ITNs.

-   **Net distribution and usage gaps**: Not all households receive enough nets, people don't always use when in bed, and some may use them for purposes other than malaria prevention.

**Solutions and Innovations:**

-   Newer **PBO (Piperonyl Butoxide) nets** and **Dual Active Ingredient (Dual-AI) nets** have been developed to counter pyrethroid resistance.

-   **Mass net distribution campaigns** and regular **monitoring** are essential to maintaining coverage.
